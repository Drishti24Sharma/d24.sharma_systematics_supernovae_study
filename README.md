# Supernova Cosmology â€“ Systematics and Dark Energy Models  
**Analysis pipeline and datasets for studying systematic effects in supernova cosmology, comparing CPL and generalized scale factor models.**

This repository contains the complete set of Python scripts and datasets used to investigate the impact of various systematic effects on dark energy constraints from Type Ia supernovae.  
The analysis compares the **Chevallierâ€“Polarskiâ€“Linder (CPL)** parametrization and a **Generalized Scale Factor** (Sinh) model, including the transformation of \((A, B)\) parameters into \((w_0, w_a)\) for direct comparison.
